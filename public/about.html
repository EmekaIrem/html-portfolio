<h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>Welcome! I’m Emeka, a full-stack web developer with a deep passion for creating interactive and user-centered 
    digital experiences. With expertise in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I bring designs to life on the front end, focusing 
    on intuitive and visually engaging interfaces. My work balances creativity and usability, ensuring that every site or 
    app feels seamless and polished.</p>

  <p>On the back end, I specialize in Node.js and PostgreSQL, where I build robust, efficient infrastructures to support 
      data management and scalability. With React as my go-to framework, I design applications that are dynamic, responsive, 
      and optimized for performance. I love working through challenges and leveraging new technologies to push the boundaries 
      of what's possible online.</p>

  <p>I’m also deeply invested in the future of web technology, developing skills in Web3 and decentralized applications (DApps). 
      By exploring blockchain solutions, I aim to create secure, innovative platforms that empower users in new ways. Let’s 
      collaborate to bring your ideas to life with precision, creativity, and a forward-looking approach!</p>
